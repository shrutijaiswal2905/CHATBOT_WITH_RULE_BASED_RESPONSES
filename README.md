# 🤖 CHATBOT WITH RULE-BASED RESPONSES
A simple yet functional **rule-based chatbot** built using Python. This project demonstrates how basic conversational AI can be implemented using hardcoded rules, conditional logic, and keyword detection. The chatbot can handle greetings, identity questions, weather queries, jokes, and more — making it a fun and educational beginner-level project.

This chatbot is a **command-line based conversational assistant** that responds to user queries using a rule-based approach. It recognizes specific keywords and phrases to generate relevant responses. The chatbot continues the conversation until the user types `"bye"`.

It's a beginner-friendly project to explore how chatbots work and lays the foundation for more advanced concepts like NLP and machine learning.
